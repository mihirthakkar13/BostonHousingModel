Questions

(1) Split the dataset into training and test sets and normalize the data (optional but recommended)
to ensure that all features are on the same scale.

(2) Train a basic linear regression model on the training data to predict the median value of
homes. Evaluate it on the test set. Report the model’s performance using metrics like
mean squared error,

(3) Compare the performance of Ridge and Lasso with the baseline model. Which one of these
models can be trained faster? Which one provides better performance on training and testing
examples? Also, compare the sparsity of the solutions provided by these models.

(4) Explain the impact of regularization on model performance.

(5) Experiment with different values of the regularization parameters (alpha) for Ridge and Lasso.
How does changing alpha impact the coefficients and model performance?
